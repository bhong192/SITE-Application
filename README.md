# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Bryant Hong**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/~codepath-proj

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[Coming from very limited experiences with web development, I personally found that creating this submission to be a process of not only learning the basics of new languages, but also familiarizing myself with the structure and flow of how elements of  HTML/CSS and JavaScript interact with one another. While beginning the initial steps of the submission, I looked over the pre-generated files to attempt to understand the sections of code that define the structure of the webpage by referencing the information in the drop down menus located in each section of the prework in addition to the other online resources previously listed. Developing a better understanding that HTML is responsible for structuring the webpage, CSS defines the styling of each of its elements, and that JavaScript handles the functionality of the page aided me in creating a more stable foundation to build off of before moving past each section of the assignment. One of the challenges I had the most difficulty with was diagnosing syntax errors that would occur when completing sections that did not provide snippets of code to reference. Specifically, hiding the stop button was a roadblock I had the most trouble with because I was unsure of how specifically to add the attribute within the opening tag of the button. When I encountered this road block, I began researching more about the syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files through the w3schools links provided and started branching out to other resources to find more examples of the implementation of this new information. Looking back, this problem was extremely trivial and an overcomplication on my end, but I am glad that I was able to learn more than was needed for this single issue since I felt noticeably more comfortable approaching and solving the other tasks following this.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[When it comes to formatting the HTML and CSS files is there a more organized way to organize the elements to locate where they are when switching between each of the files? I found that while I was working on the assignment I would often have to skim through the file to locate where I created the styling for a particular component of the webpage. On a more general scope, when developing good practices for web development what are some ways to learn some good practices? I often found myself wondering if there were better ways to format my files or write cleaner code to better make sense of the individual files. With the HTML tags specifically, it took me some time to realize where tags began and ended especially when they were nested. Because this was my first time examining these types of files more closely, I began to wonder if this was due to me being new to the field or an area where I can improve in. ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

[If I were to have more time with this assignment, I would definitely want to attempt completing the optional tasks and add my own twists as I went along. I was specifically interested in trying to create new tones for the buttons by editing the freqMap object that was provided since I never had any experience messing around with audio components of a webpage. Randomly generating a pattern with creating more leeway for the player by implementing the 3 strikes feature was also something I was interested in implementing since I had my fair share of frustrations with the game only providing one chance for the player to recreate the pattern correctly. But overall, if I had more time with this assignment I would want to complete the optional tasks and possibly add the capability for the user to decide how they wanted to structure the game by letting them choose the number of buttons, speed, and difficulty of the game to add another layer of user interaction with the game.  ]
